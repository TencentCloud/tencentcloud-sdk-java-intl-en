     *This API is used to judge whether a person in an image corresponds to a given `PersonId`. For more information on `PersonId`, please see [Group Management APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/45015?from_cn_redirect=1). 

The `VerifyFace` API judges whether a person is someone specified whose information is stored in a group, and there may be multiple face images of "someone". By contrast, the [CompareFace](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/44987?from_cn_redirect=1) API judges the similarity between two faces.

This API recognizes each face image of a person as an independent one. By contrast, the [VerifyPerson](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/44982?from_cn_redirect=1) API fuses the features of all face images of a person; for example, if a person has 4 face images, the VerifyPerson API will fuse the features of the 4 face images and generate the summarized facial features of the person to make the person verification (i.e., judging whether the face image to be recognized is of a specified person) more accurate.

- Please use the signature algorithm v3 to calculate the signature in the common parameters, that is, set the parameter `SignatureMethod` to `TC3-HMAC-SHA256`.
