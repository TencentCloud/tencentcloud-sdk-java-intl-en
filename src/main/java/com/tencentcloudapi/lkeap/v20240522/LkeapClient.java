    /**
     *### API Features Call the API to initiate a chat request. The concurrency limit for API calls of a single account is 5. To use OpenAI compatible APIs, please refer to [Deepseek OpenAI Chat API](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1772/115969) #### Online Experience If you want to directly experience the DeepSeek model on the web page, it is recommended that you go to [Tencent Cloud TI-AppStudio](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/lke) and use [ DeepSeek Online Assistant](https://lke.cloud.tencent.com/webim_exp/#/chat/wQrAwR). #### Supported models - DeepSeek-V3-0324 (parameter value of model is **deepseek-v3-0324**) - DeepSeek-V3-0324 is a 671B parameter MoE model with outstanding advantages in programming and technical capabilities, context understanding, and long text processing. - Supports 64K context length, maximum input 56K, maximum output 8K (excluding thought chain). - Note: Compared with DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-V3-0324 only updated the model weights without increasing the number of parameters. The total model size is 685B, including 671B of main model weights and 14B of multi-token prediction (MTP) module weights. Subsequently, the main model parameter count will be described. - DeepSeek-V3 (model parameter value: **deepseek-v3**) - DeepSeek-V3 is a 671B parameter MoE model with outstanding advantages in multiple tasks such as encyclopedic knowledge and math reasoning. Its evaluation scores rank first among open-source models on mainstream ranked lists. - Supports 64K context length, maximum input 56K, maximum output 8K (excluding thought chain). - DeepSeek-R1 (model parameter value: **deepseek-r1**) - DeepSeek-R1 is a 671B model trained with reinforcement learning. The reasoning process includes a large amount of reflection and verification, and the length of the thought chain can reach tens of thousands of characters. This series of models has excellent reasoning effectiveness in math, coding, and various complex logic reasoning tasks, and displays the complete thinking process for users. - Supports 64K context length, maximum input 56K, maximum output 8K (excluding thought chain). ### Billing Description - Standard billing (effective from February 26, 2025). The billing mode is postpaid hourly settlement. To ensure the normal use of your account resources, please [open postpaid](https://lke.cloud.tencent.com/lke#/app/system/charge/postpaid) in advance and [recharge](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/recharge) in time. - DeepSeek-R1 model | Input: 0.004 CNY/thousand tokens | Output (including thought chain): 0.016 CNY/thousand tokens. - DeepSeek-V3 model | Input: 0.002 CNY/thousand tokens | Output: 0.008 CNY/thousand tokens. - DeepSeek-V3-0324 model | Input: 0.002 CNY/thousand tokens | Output: 0.008 CNY/thousand tokens. ### OpenAI Compatible Protocol API The Knowledge Engine Atomic Power Large Model Dialogue API is compatible with the interface specifications of OpenAI, which means you can directly use the SDK officially provided by OpenAI to call the large model chat API. You only need to replace base_url and [api_key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1772/115970) with relevant configuration. No additional modifications to your application are required. You can seamlessly switch your application to the corresponding large model. Please refer to the documentation: [Deepseek OpenAI Chat API](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1772/115969). > base_url: https://api.lkeap.cloud.tencent.com/v1 > To obtain api_key, please refer to [API KEY Management](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1772/115970) ### Quick Access 1. Complete [real-name authentication](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer/auth). 2. Go to [Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/lkeap) to activate the service for the master account. If it is a sub-account, it needs to be authorized by the main account in [Permission Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam), and associated with a preset policy. Policy name: QcloudLKEAPFullAccess. 3. Debug the API online through API Explorer (https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=lkeap&Version=2024-05-22&Action=ChatCompletions). 4. Use [official SDK ](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1772/115963#SDK) to call this API (Python/Java/PHP/Go/Node.js/. NET and other languages are supported). ----------- ### SDK Call Example Call this API through local code (support languages such as Python, Java, PHP, Go, Node.js, .NET): The following code takes Python as an example to show how to access the DeepSeek model API on Tencent Cloud. (1) Install environment ``` python3 -m pip install --upgrade tencentcloud-sdk-python-common python3 -m pip install --upgrade tencentcloud-sdk-python-lkeap ``` (2) Sample code - Among them, SecretKey and SecretID need to be obtained from the Tencent Cloud console. - The field "Model" in the parameter "params" can be set to "deepseek-r1" or "deepseek-v3". ``` # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import json from tencentcloud.common.common_client import CommonClient from tencentcloud.common import credential from tencentcloud.common.exception.tencent_cloud_sdk_exception import TencentCloudSDKException from tencentcloud.common.profile.client_profile import ClientProfile from tencentcloud.common.profile.http_profile import HttpProfile class NonStreamResponse(object): def __init__(self): self.response = "" def _deserialize(self, obj): self.response = json.dumps(obj) try: # Instantiate an authentication object. Input parameters are required, including the Tencent Cloud account SecretId and SecretKey. Here, you also need to pay attention to keeping the confidentiality of the key pair. # Code leakage may lead to the leakage of SecretId and SecretKey and threaten the security of all resources under the account. The following code examples are for reference only. It is recommended to use keys in a more secure way. Please refer to: https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1278/85305 # Obtain the key in the official website console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi cred = credential.Credential("", "") httpProfile = HttpProfile() httpProfile.endpoint = "lkeap.tencentcloudapi.com" httpProfile.reqTimeout = 40000 # The streaming API may take a longer time.  clientProfile = ClientProfile() clientProfile.httpProfile = httpProfile params = "{\"Model\":\"deepseek-r1\",\"Messages\":[{\"Role\":\"user\",\"Content\":\"Hello\"}],\"Stream\":true}"; common_client = CommonClient("lkeap", "2024-05-22", cred, "ap-guangzhou", profile=clientProfile) resp = common_client._call_and_deserialize("ChatCompletions", json.loads(params), NonStreamResponse) if isinstance(resp, NonStreamResponse): # Non-streaming response print(resp.response) else: # Streaming response for event in resp: print(event) except TencentCloudSDKException as err: print(err) ``` **DeepSeek-R1 usage recommendations** 1. Set the temperature in the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetition or incoherent output. 2. Avoid adding system prompts. All descriptions should be included in user prompts.
